                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>
                    As a Data Scientist and MS Business Analytics & AI student at UT Dallas, I am passionate about leveraging data to drive actionable insights. As a Business Analyst Intern at AVIK, I managed the full data analysis life cycle for business development, analyzed 75+ data points weekly, integrated datasets with SQL, and facilitated strategic discussions with senior leadership to support key business decisions. Previously, as a Data Analyst Intern at THE ZEAL, I optimized data integrity, designed interactive dashboards, and improved workflow efficiency using Python, SQL, and Tableau. My projects include a Personality Classification System, where I applied machine learning to analyze 1,000+ profiles, achieving 90% classification accuracy. With a strong foundation in data science, I’m eager to apply my skills in real-world analytics challenges and am actively seeking a Summer 2025 internship in data science.
